# ESPS-AND-ISPS
Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are changes in the membrane potential of a postsynaptic neuron that result from the opening of ion channels in response to a stimulus. They differ in the following ways:

- Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) depolarize the membrane and move the potential closer to the threshold for an action potential to be generated. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) hyperpolarize the membrane and move the potential farther away from the threshold, decreasing the likelihood of an action potential occurring.
- EPSPs are induced by excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and acetylcholine, that open sodium or calcium channels and allow positive ions to enter the cell. IPSPs are induced by inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glycine, that open potassium or chloride channels and allow negative ions to enter or leave the cell.
- EPSPs and IPSPs can summate, or add up, in the postsynaptic neuron. If the net effect of the summation is a depolarization that reaches the threshold, an action potential will be fired. If the net effect is a hyperpolarization or a subthreshold depolarization, no action potential will be fired.

Here is a table that compares and contrasts excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials:


| Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs) | Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSPs) |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| - Caused by the opening of **sodium** or **calcium** channels in the postsynaptic membrane | - Caused by the opening of **potassium** or **chloride** channels in the postsynaptic membrane |
| - Result in a **depolarization** of the postsynaptic membrane, making it more positive | - Result in a **hyperpolarization** of the postsynaptic membrane, making it more negative |
| - Increase the likelihood of an **action potential** in the postsynaptic neuron | - Decrease the likelihood of an **action potential** in the postsynaptic neuron |
| - Induced by **excitatory neurotransmitters** such as glutamate and acetylcholine | - Induced by **inhibitory neurotransmitters** such as GABA and glycine |


# The Effects of denervation on skeletal muscle and acetylcholine production at the neuromuscular junction are as follows:

1. **Skeletal Muscle**: Denervation of skeletal muscle results in a rapid and programmed loss in muscle size and performance, 
termed muscle atrophy¹. 
Previous researches considered it a result of protein homeostasis lacking¹. 
Denervation triggers numerous molecular responses in skeletal muscle, including the activation of catabolic pathways and oxidative stress, leading to progressive muscle atrophy². 
However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the wasting of skeletal muscle due to denervation are not well understood³. 
Some of the pathways that have been implicated in denervation-induced muscle atrophy are the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the autophagy-lysosome system, the endoplasmic reticulum stress, the mitochondrial dysfunction, and the inflammatory response². 
Moreover, denervation also affects the satellite cells, the resident stem cells of skeletal muscle, which are essential for muscle regeneration and maintenance⁴. 
Denervation impairs the activation and proliferation of satellite cells, leading to reduced muscle fiber repair and regeneration⁴.

2. **Acetylcholine Production at the Neuromuscular Junction**: Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter that mediates the communication between the motor neuron and the skeletal muscle fiber at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)⁵. 
ACh is synthesized by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the presynaptic terminal and stored in synaptic vesicles⁵. 
Upon nerve stimulation, ACh is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the postsynaptic membrane, triggering muscle contraction⁵. 
Denervation leads to a decrease in ACh production and release, as well as a decrease in ChAT activity and expression⁶. This results in a reduced endplate potential and a loss of effective neuromuscular transmission⁶. Furthermore, denervation also induces changes in the expression and distribution of AChRs on the postsynaptic membrane, such as a decrease in the number and density of AChRs, a shift in the subunit composition of AChRs, 
and a dispersion of AChRs from the endplate to the extrasynaptic regions⁷. 
These changes impair the responsiveness of the muscle fiber to ACh and contribute to muscle atrophy⁷..

Certainly, I'll present the information in a table format:

**Note:**
- "N/A" indicates that the specific process or function is not applicable in the absence of neural input due to denervation.
- The effects mentioned are general trends and may vary based on factors such as the duration of denervation and the specific characteristics of the muscle involved.
