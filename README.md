# ESPS-AND-ISPS
Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are changes in the membrane potential of a postsynaptic neuron that result from the opening of ion channels in response to a stimulus. They differ in the following ways:

- Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) depolarize the membrane and move the potential closer to the threshold for an action potential to be generated. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) hyperpolarize the membrane and move the potential farther away from the threshold, decreasing the likelihood of an action potential occurring.
- EPSPs are induced by excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and acetylcholine, that open sodium or calcium channels and allow positive ions to enter the cell. IPSPs are induced by inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glycine, that open potassium or chloride channels and allow negative ions to enter or leave the cell.
- EPSPs and IPSPs can summate, or add up, in the postsynaptic neuron. If the net effect of the summation is a depolarization that reaches the threshold, an action potential will be fired. If the net effect is a hyperpolarization or a subthreshold depolarization, no action potential will be fired.

Here is a table that compares and contrasts excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials:


| Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs) | Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSPs) |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| - Caused by the opening of **sodium** or **calcium** channels in the postsynaptic membrane | - Caused by the opening of **potassium** or **chloride** channels in the postsynaptic membrane |
| - Result in a **depolarization** of the postsynaptic membrane, making it more positive | - Result in a **hyperpolarization** of the postsynaptic membrane, making it more negative |
| - Increase the likelihood of an **action potential** in the postsynaptic neuron | - Decrease the likelihood of an **action potential** in the postsynaptic neuron |
| - Induced by **excitatory neurotransmitters** such as glutamate and acetylcholine | - Induced by **inhibitory neurotransmitters** such as GABA and glycine |
