The Effects of denervation on skeletal muscle and acetylcholine production at the neuromuscular junction are as follows:

1. **Skeletal Muscle**: Denervation of skeletal muscle results in a rapid and programmed loss in muscle size and performance, termed muscle atrophy¹. Previous researches considered it a result of protein homeostasis lacking¹. Denervation triggers numerous molecular responses in skeletal muscle, including the activation of catabolic pathways and oxidative stress, leading to progressive muscle atrophy². However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the wasting of skeletal muscle due to denervation are not well understood³. Some of the pathways that have been implicated in denervation-induced muscle atrophy are the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the autophagy-lysosome system, the endoplasmic reticulum stress, the mitochondrial dysfunction, and the inflammatory response². Moreover, denervation also affects the satellite cells, the resident stem cells of skeletal muscle, which are essential for muscle regeneration and maintenance⁴. Denervation impairs the activation and proliferation of satellite cells, leading to reduced muscle fiber repair and regeneration⁴.

2. **Acetylcholine Production at the Neuromuscular Junction**: Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter that mediates the communication between the motor neuron and the skeletal muscle fiber at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)⁵. ACh is synthesized by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the presynaptic terminal and stored in synaptic vesicles⁵. Upon nerve stimulation, ACh is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the postsynaptic membrane, triggering muscle contraction⁵. Denervation leads to a decrease in ACh production and release, as well as a decrease in ChAT activity and expression⁶. This results in a reduced endplate potential and a loss of effective neuromuscular transmission⁶. Furthermore, denervation also induces changes in the expression and distribution of AChRs on the postsynaptic membrane, such as a decrease in the number and density of AChRs, a shift in the subunit composition of AChRs, and a dispersion of AChRs from the endplate to the extrasynaptic regions⁷. These changes impair the responsiveness of the muscle fiber to ACh and contribute to muscle atrophy⁷..
